## Installation

```bash
npm i @rsksmart/rif-ui
```

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

In order to experience all the benefits of this library, we recommend to wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider` component from Material-UI and pass in our [Material-UI theme](https://material-ui.com/es/customization/theming/).

```tsx
import React, { FC } from 'react'
import { ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles'
import { theme, Typography } from '@rsksmart/rif-ui'
import '@rsksmart/rif-ui/dist/index.css'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Typography color='primary'>Hello world :)</Typography>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

### Using Header and PageTemplate components

The `Header` and `PageTemplate` components were styled and designed to work together. So, whenever you need one of them, we suggest to follow the next example

```tsx
import { Header, PageTemplate, theme, Typography } from '@rsksmart/rif-ui'
import { ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles'
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Header/>
      <PageTemplate>
        <Typography color='primary'>Hello world :)</Typography>
      </PageTemplate>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </ThemeProvider>
)
```

## Example folder

If you want to try this library without creating a new project you can clone this repo and follow the next steps:

1. At `rif-ui`:

```
npm start
```

2. In another terminal:

```
cd example/ && npm start
```

3. (Optional) Import the components, assets or services that you want in the `example/src/App.js` file following the [Usage](#usage) section to see them in action.
